## General info
This project is my personal web developer portfolio. This project is an improvement on a former website that I built at the beginning of my software boot camp and an updated version that I built a few months ago as I build toward being employer competitive. It contains actual examples of my work including 2 collaborative coding projects and some exemplary homework assignments as well as links to my GitHub repository, deployed projects, LinkedIn profile and resume.

I consulted Bootstrap 4 (https://getbootstrap.com/) and W3Schools (https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_smooth_scroll.asp) extensively in creating my project. Some other resources that I used include: Stack Overflow (#https://stackoverflow.com/), the GitLab repository for my course, specifically referencing the in-class activities and the ReadMe for homework 8. de
